## Objective

The main objective of this project is to provide a framework for uploading a custom Model Customization Platform (MCP) server to Clarifai using the Python SDK. This server enables seamless integration and deployment of AI models from various sources, including:

- **Clarifai Models:** Utilize pre-trained or custom models available on the Clarifai platform.
- **Hugging Face Models:** Integrate models from the Hugging Face Hub for NLP, vision, and more.
- **OpenAI Models:** Leverage OpenAI's powerful models for advanced AI tasks.

This project aims to simplify the process of deploying and managing custom AI inference endpoints on Clarifai, supporting a wide range of use cases and model sources.
